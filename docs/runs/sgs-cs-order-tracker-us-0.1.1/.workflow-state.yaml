    decisions:
      - id: D-001
        decision: "Use create-next-app for scaffolding"
        rationale: "Official, well-maintained, includes best practices"
      - id: D-002
        decision: "Use pnpm as package manager"
        rationale: "Faster, disk-efficient, recommended for Next.js"
      - id: D-003
        decision: "Install minimal shadcn/ui components initially"
        rationale: "Add components as needed, avoid bloat"
      - id: D-004
        decision: "Create placeholder folders for future features"
        rationale: "Establishes structure without implementing features"
      - id: D-005
        decision: "Database schema as placeholder (no migrations)"
        rationale: "US-0.3.1 will handle actual database setup"
